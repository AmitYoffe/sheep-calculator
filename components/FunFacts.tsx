    `The value of a sheep can vary widely depending on factors such as breed, age, health,
  and location. Historically, in barter economies, the value of a sheep would be negotiated based on its usefulness for wool, meat, milk, and breeding.
  In modern times, the value of a sheep is often influenced by market conditions and specific characteristics of the sheep.
  As of recent data, the price of a sheep in the United States can range from around $150 to $300 per head,
  although high-quality breeding sheep or those with specific desirable traits can be worth significantly more.`,
